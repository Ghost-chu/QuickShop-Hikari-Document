# Permission

Permissions control most QuickShop features, and you can control most features using QuickShop-Hikari's permissions.

## Basic LuckPerms Guide

To give a group a specific permission, you can use:  
**Grant**: `/lp group <group> permission set <permission> true`  

To revoke it, execute:  
**Revoke**: `/lp group <group> permission unset <permission>`

If a permission is included in a *Simple Permission*, you can explicitly override to disable it:  
**Force disable**: `/lp group <group> permission set <permission> false`

If you don't know what the name of your group is, use `default`.

## Simple Permissions

QuickShop provides a simple permission that allows you to quickly setup permissions, they are:

`quickshop.player` which contains all [sub permission nodes](https://github.com/QuickShop-Community/QuickShop-Hikari/blob/f7b12693d753fa9d2f147238b3afdf0e4030cfa6/quickshop-bukkit/src/main/resources/plugin.yml#L78) that players required.  
`quickshop.moderator` which includes all [sub permission nodes](https://github.com/QuickShop-Community/QuickShop-Hikari/blob/f7b12693d753fa9d2f147238b3afdf0e4030cfa6/quickshop-bukkit/src/main/resources/plugin.yml#L101) that moderators required.  

The most significant advantage of using Simple Permission is that when a new permission is added to QuickShop, it will be automatically authorized without additional configuration.
