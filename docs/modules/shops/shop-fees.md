## Creation fee

It is controlled by `shop.cost`, set it to `0` for free.  
You can refund the creation cost by turn on `shop.refund` option, and if you want refund player from quickshop tax account, you can also turn on option `shop.refund-from-tax-account`, but player may won't receive the refund if tax account run out of money.

## Price changing fee

To prevent player change their shops price too frequently, you can turn on price changing fee by turn on option `shop.price-change-requires-fee`.  
After the option is enabled, player need to pay the tax account money that specficed by `shop.fee-for-price-change` option everytime their changes.

## Naming fee

You can set that require player pay for naming their shop by set option `shop.name-fee` to an non-zero number.  
Everytime player want to change their shop's name, player must pay for it.

## Ongoing Fee

To prevent players hold massive idle shops on your server, or keep the market balance, you can enable on-going fee.  

When this feature enabled, player need to pay `shop.ongoing-fee.cost-per-shop`$ every `shop.ongoing-fee.ticks` game ticks, for every single shop they're owned.  

If player cannot afford the ongoing-fee, the shops will be deleted.

## Tax

QuickShop provide a system that allow you to tax.

### Configuration

```yaml
#Tax amount (decimal)
#Example: P1 buys $50 worth of stuff from P2.  Therefore, P1 loses $50, P2 gains $(1-0.05)*50, and the tax-account gains $(0.05)*50.
tax: 0.05

#The fake player where the tax money goes to.
#Set this to "" to disable it (Taxing will still work but not deposit to any account)
tax-account: tax

# Disable taxes for unlimited shop

#Whether to show taxes paid when selling to a shop
show-tax: false
```

### Transaction Tax

`1` means `100%`, `0.05` means `5%`, you need convert the percentage to decimal format.  

You can also turn on `show-tax` to allow player see the taxes included in transaction.

Depends on the difference in economy plugins and the design of your server, default value may won't work well, and you might want change it.

`tax-account` accepts both player username and player's uuid.
