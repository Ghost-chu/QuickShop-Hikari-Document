# AdvancedRegionMarket

ARM compatibility module added [AdvancedRegionMarket](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/advancedregionmarket.58732/) supports.

## How it works?

Compatibility Module will register a listener to listen RemoveRegionEvent and RestoreRegionEvent calls, and remove shops in those regions.
