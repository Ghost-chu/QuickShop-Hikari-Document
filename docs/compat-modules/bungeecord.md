This is a BungeeCord plugin, you need install it on your BungeeCord's plugins folder.

## How does it works

BungeeCord Bridge plugins will register `quickshop:bungee` channel for fowarding the player commands, chats to sub server when sub server waiting for player's input.

All forwarding is indicated by QuickShop-Hikari on the Spigot server and ends when it is not needed.
