This is a BungeeCord plugin, you need install it within your BungeeCord's plugins folder.

## How does it work?

BungeeCord Bridge plugins will register a `quickshop:bungee` channel for fowarding the player commands and chats to a sub-server when the sub-server is waiting for the player's input.

All forwarding is indicated by QuickShop-Hikari on the Spigot server and ends when it is not needed.
