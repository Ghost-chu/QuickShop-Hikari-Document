This is a BungeeCord plugin, you need install it on your BungeeCord's plugins folder, you also need depend plugin [Addon-BungeeCord](./bungeecord.md).

## How does it works

BungeeCord Geyser bridge plugin gives you ability to let the QuickShop-Hikari (and it's addon) that installed backend Spigot server to know if a player is a Geyser or Floodgate player.

The plugin itself does not provide any functionality, it only functions as an API.
