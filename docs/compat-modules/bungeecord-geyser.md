This is a BungeeCord plugin, you need install it within your BungeeCord's plugins folder. You also need the dependant plugin [Addon-BungeeCord](./bungeecord.md).

## How does it work?

The BungeeCord-Geyser bridge plugin gives you ability to let  QuickShop-Hikari (and it's addon) on the installed backend Spigot server to know if a player is a Geyser or Floodgate player.

This plugin itself does not provide any functionality, it only functions as an API.
