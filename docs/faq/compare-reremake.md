## Which one should I use?

Well, it depends on what your needs are.  
If you have an old server (<1.20) instance, Reremake is your only choice.  
~~If you are in China which has GFW interfere, you also should consider Reremake because it doesn't need to load libraries from Global Internet.~~ Solved in 6.0.0.0.  

If none of these applies, give Hikari a try!
