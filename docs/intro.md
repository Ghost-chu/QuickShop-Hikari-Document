# Welcome to QuickShop-Hikari Documents
 
QuickShop Hikari is a shop plugin for Minecraft that lets the players create chest shops, which allows them to quickly sell and buy items from others without using any commands.  
All commands in QuickShop are not even needed for regular gameplay.

This version of QuickShop ([QuickShop-Community/QuickShop-Hikar][quickshop-hikari]) is a fork
from [PotatoCraft-Studio's version][quickshop-potato] which itself is a fork from the [Reremake][quickshop-ghostchu] of
the [original QuickShop][quickshop-original].

QuickShop Hikari is maintained by creatorfromhell and has the goal of modernizing the core content of QuickShop and adapting it to
the latest versions of Minecraft.
